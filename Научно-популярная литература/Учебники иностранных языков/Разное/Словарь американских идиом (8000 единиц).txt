                Словарь американских идиом: 8000 единиц


   Это  обновленное  и  дополненное  издание,  содержащее  более  8000
идиоматических слов и выражений, причем  каждое  из  которых  снабжено
грамматическим объяснением и практическим примером.  Словарь  содержит
лексемные  идиомы,  фразеологические  единицы  и  поговорки,   имеющие
особенное значение. В нем приведены наиболее употребительные выражения
только американского  английского  языка.  Этот  словарь  -  идеальное
пособие  для  студентов,  часто  разъезжающих  бизнесменов  и   просто
путешественников.


                              Предисловие

                           Что такое идиома?

   Если в незнакомом тексте Вы понимаете каждое слово,  но  не  можете
понять смысла. Ваши  затруднения,  вероятно,  вызваны  идиоматическими
выражениями. Предположим, Вы прочитали или услышали следующий текст:

        Sam is a real cool cat. He  never  blows  his  stack  and
     hardly ever flies off the handle. What's more, he knows  how
     to get away with things... Well, of course,  he  is  getting
     on, too. His hair is pepper and salt, but he  knows  how  to
     make up for lost time by taking it easy. He gets  up  early,
     works out, and turns in early. He takes care of the hot  dog
     stand like a breeze until he gets time  off.  Sam's  got  it
     made; this is it for him.

   Очевидно, что этот стиль нельзя назвать  строго  литературным,  но,
тем не менее, американцы в разговоре друг с другом  часто  употребляют
такие выражения. Если Вы иностранец и знаете слова  cool  (прохладно),
cat (кошка), blow (дуть), stack (кучи), fly (лететь), handle (ручка) и
т.д.,  Вы  не  поймете  данный  образец   разговорного   американского
английского языка, потому что те переводы слов,  которые  находятся  в
обычных английских словарях, не дадут Вам точного значения приведенных
выше выражений. Из этого следует, что идиома - это новое,  неожиданное
значение группы слов, каждое из  которых  обладает  своим  собственным
значением.   Ниже   Вы   найдете   перевод   этого   разговорного    и
нелитературного  текста  на  более  формальный  вариант  американского
диалекта:

        Sam is really a calm person. He never  loses  control  of
     himself and hardly ever becomes too angry.  Furthermore,  he
     knows how to manage his business financially by using a  few
     tricks... Needless to say, he, too, is  getting  older.  His
     hair is  beginning  to  turn  gray,  but  he  knows  how  to
     compensate for wasted time  by  relaxing.  He  rises  early,
     exercises, and goes to bed early. He manages his frankfurter
     stand without visible effort, until  it  is  someone  else's
     turn to work there. Sam is successful; he  has  reached  his
     life's goal.

        "Сэм очень тихий человек. Он никогда не  теряет  контроль
     над собой и редко сердится. Кроме того, он знает, как  вести
     свое дело с финансовой точки  зрения,  употребляя  некоторые
     хитрости... Безусловно, он тоже стареет. Его волосы  седеют,
     но он умеет восстанавливать  потраченные  силы  отдыхом.  Он
     рано встает, делает гимнастику  и  рано  ложится.  Со  своей
     работой в колбасном  магазине  он  справляется  без  особого
     труда, успевая все сделать до  того,  как  его  сменят.  Сэм
     вполне счастлив, - он достиг цели своей жизни".

   Некоторые идиомы из этого небольшого списка  можно  найти  в  нашем
словаре. Большая часть идиом принадлежит  обыкновенным  грамматическим
классам или частям речи. Так,  например,  некоторые  идиомы  по  своей
природе - типичные глаголы: get away with, get up, work out, turn in и
т.д. Не меньшее число идиоматических выражений - имена. Так,  hot  dog
(сосиска в хлебе), The White House (Белый Дом - официальная резиденция
американского президента) - имена существительные. Некоторые из  идиом
- имена прилагательные: так, в нашем примере pepper and salt (седеющие
черные или темные  волосы)  обозначает  цвет  волос.  Многие  из  этих
выражений, как, например, like a  breeze  (легко),  hammer  and  tongs
(violently,  насильственно)  -  наречия.   Идиоматические   выражения,
относящиеся  к  одному   из   обыкновенных   грамматических   классов,
называются лексемными идиомами (lexemic idioms).
   Вторая основная группа  идиом  состоит  из  фраз,  таких  как  наши
примеры to fly off the handle (потерять контроль над собой) и to  blow
one's stack (прийти в ярость).  В  американском  варианте  английского
языка  подобные  выражения  встречаются  очень  часто.  Некоторые   из
наиболее известных  следующие:  to  kick  the  bucket  (die,  умереть,
сыграть в ящик, отбросить копыта), to be up the creek (in danger, быть
в опасности), to seize the bull by the horns (face a problem squarely,
разрешать проблему или задачу, стоящую перед нами, взять быка за рога)
и т.д. Идиомы этой  группы  называются  оборотами  речи,  по-английски
tournures  (из  французского  языка).  Они   не   принадлежат   одному
какому-либо грамматическому классу (части речи), и переводить их нужно
не словом, а группой слов.
   Форма подобных идиоматических выражений устоялась;  многие  из  них
совсем  "застыли"  и  не  могут  функционировать   в   другой   форме.
Рассмотрим, например,  идиому  tо  kick  the  bucket  (die,  умереть).
Употребив  эту  форму  в  пассивном   залоге,   мы   отказываемся   от
идиоматического смысла, получив выражение the bucket has  been  kicked
by the cowboy (ковбой ударил ведро ногой). Впрочем, даже это выражение
может изменяться по времени, так  как  мы  можем  сказать  the  cowboy
kicked the bucket, the cowboy will kick the  bucket,  the  cowboy  has
kicked  the  bucket  и  т.д.  Проблема,  можно  ли   употреблять   это
идиоматическое выражение в герундивной форме  (герундив,  gerundive  -
слово, производное от  глагола  с  помощью  суффикса  -ing,  например,
singing от sing,  eating  от  eat  и  т.д.),  не  решена  окончательно
учеными-лингвистами и носителями языка. Правильная эта форма или  нет,
мы не рекомендуем употреблять выражения типа his  kicking  the  bucket
surprised us all.
   Следующий большой класс идиом состоит из поговорок, таких как don't
count your chickens before  they're  hatched  (do  not  celebrate  the
outcome of an undertaking prematurely - you may  fail  and  will  look
ridiculous); буквально: "не считайте кур, пока они  не  вылупились  из
яиц"; русский вариант поговорки звучит:  "цыплят  по  осени  считают".
Большое число поговорок  пришло  в  американский  вариант  английского
языка  из  литературных  источников  или  же  от   первых   английских
иммигрантов в Америку.
   Своим рождением идиомы обязаны тому, что  мы  чаще  используем  уже
существующие слова для выражения новых идей, чем создаем новые слова с
помощью фонем языка. Фактически нет  языков,  в  которых  не  было  бы
идиом.  Возьмем,  например,  слова  "ма  шанг",  китайское  выражение,
которое  значит  "быстро".   Переведенное   дословно,   оно   означает
"лошадиная спина". Связь понятий лошадиной спины и быстроты  очевидна:
раньше, до появления поезда, автомобиля и самолета, быстрее всего было
путешествовать верхом на лошади. Китайское выражение "ма шанг" было бы
аналогом русской фразы:  "Торопитесь,  нам  надо  ехать  на  лошадиной
спине". Такая форма была бы вполне понятной носителю  русского  языка,
но иностранец  должен  был  бы  понять,  что  это  идиома.  Даже  если
иностранец никогда не слышал выражения "ма шанг" (лошадиная спина), он
может догадаться, что это значит; однако, во многих  случаях  подобные
догадки ошибочны.
   Например,  возьмем  английскую  идиому  the  die  is  cast  (жребий
брошен). Вряд ли, не зная ее точного выражения,  Вы  догадаетесь,  что
это выражение значит:  "Я  решил,  и  больше  не  могу  изменить  свое
решение". Зная точное значение, Вы можете догадаться, как возникло это
идиоматическое выражение: кость, брошенная во время игры в  кости,  по
правилам может быть брошена только один раз, независимо от результата.
Многие знают, что  эту  фразу  произнес  Юлий  Цезарь,  когда  перешел
Рубикон, что явилось началом войны.
   Как  научиться  употреблять  идиоматическое  выражение   правильно?
Прежде всего, подождите, пока Вы не услышите идиому от  человека,  для
которого американский английский - родной язык. Если  Вы  неоднократно
слышали идиому и вполне поняли ее  значение,  Вы  сами  можете  начать
употреблять это выражение. Предположим, молодая  девушка  очень  хочет
выйти замуж. Она  может  выбирать  между  двумя  возможными  женихами,
назовем их Павел и Николай. Павел немолод, некрасив и небогат,  но  он
уже сделал предложение и готов жениться хоть завтра. Николай красив  и
богат, но он пока не собирается  жениться  и  неизвестно,  женится  ли
когда-нибудь. После  некоторого  размышления  девушка  решает  принять
предложение Павла, боясь остаться  старой  девой.  Если  вскоре  после
свадьбы Николай признается  ей,  что  мечтает  быть  ее  мужем,  нашей
героине останется только сказать "Oh, well, the die is cast..."  ("Что
делать, жребий брошен"). Если,  оказавшись  в  подобной  ситуации,  Вы
произносите эту фразу, беседуя с американцем, и он смотрит  на  Вас  с
сочувствием и не переспрашивает: "Что Вы имеете в виду?"  -  считайте,
что Вы достигли первого успеха, употребив новую  идиому  в  правильном
контексте. Американцы  относятся  к  иностранцам  более  лояльно,  чем
другие нации,  но  они,  конечно,  оценят,  сколь  бегло  Вы  говорите
по-английски. Использование идиом поможет Вам  установить  контакт  со
слушателем и избежать репутации  "слишком  серьезного"  человека.  Чем
больше идиом Вы употребляете в правильном контексте, тем лучше  о  Вас
будут думать Ваши собеседники.


                    Как пользоваться этим словарем?

   Словарь был составлен для  людей,  говорящих  по-английски,  но  не
родившихся   в   Америке.   Словарь   содержит    лексемные    идиомы,
фразеологические единицы  и  поговорки,  имеющие  особенное  значение.
Возможно, некоторые из идиоматических выражений Вам уже знакомы, и  Вы
понимаете, что они  означают.  Найдите  в  словаре  перевод  одной  из
следующих идиом, значение которой Вы уже знаете,  -  это  поможет  Вам
понять, как пользоваться этой  книгой:  boyfriend,  girlfriend,  piggy
bank, get even, give up, going to, keep on, keep your mouth shut, lead
somebody by the nose, look after, show off, throw away, all  over,  in
love, mixed-up, out of this world, I'll say.
   Чтобы научиться пользоваться словарем,  несколько  раз  внимательно
изучите  предписания   и   попрактикуйтесь   в   нахождении   значения
идиоматических выражений. Если  Вы  услышите  идиому,  которой  нет  в
книге, то, имея некоторый опыт работы с  нашим  словарем,  Вы  сможете
найти ее значение и выписать его для себя.  Заведите  Ваш  собственный
список идиом и храните его вместе с Вашим  обычным  словарем.  Пошлите
нам Ваши наблюдения и замечания.
   Как узнать, поможет ли Вам "Словарь идиом"  понять  трудную  фразу?
Иногда догадаться, о чем идет речь, не сложно, как в выражениях  puppy
love, fun house, dog-eat-dog, mixed-up. Если же Вы не можете перевести
выражение, выберите основное слово из самой трудной  части  и  найдите
его в словаре. Если это первое слово идиомы, Вы найдете  всю  фразу  и
перевод к ней. Таким образом, выражение bats in the belfry  напечатано
в этом словаре под буквой  В,  слово  bats.  Если  слово,  которое  Вы
выбрали, не первое слово идиомы,  Вы  найдете  список  идиом,  которые
содержат это слово. Например, слово toe  (палец  ноги)  Вы  найдете  в
статьях CURL ONE'S HAIR or CURL ONE'S TOES, ON ONE'S TOES, STEP ON THE
TOES (OF SOMEBODY). Конечно, Вы  можете  столкнуться  с  тем,  что  не
понимаете некоторые  фразы,  потому  что  Вам  незнакомы  обыкновенные
слова, а не из-за обилия идиоматических выражений. В этом  случае  Вам
поможет  обычный  словарь.  Обратите  внимание,  что  в  этом  словаре
приведены  наиболее  употребительные  выражения  только  американского
английского языка, без учета  идиоматики,  например,  британского  или
австралийского диалектов. Словарь, содержащий  идиомы  всех  диалектов
английского  языка,   был   бы   международным   словарем   английских
идиоматических выражений.  В  настоящее  время  такой  книги  нет,  но
надеемся, что в будущем она будет написана.


                         Типы словарных статей

   Этот  словарь  содержит  четыре  типа   статей:   главные   статьи,
продолжающиеся статьи, статьи-ссылки и  указательные  статьи.  Главная
статья включает полное  объяснение  идиомы.  Продолжающаяся  статья  -
фраза,  происходящая  от   другой   идиомы,   но   которая   была   бы
самостоятельной  единицей,  если  бы  она  была  напечатана  в   своем
собственном алфавитном месте.  Эти  производные  идиомы  приводятся  в
конце главной статьи, например,  fence  sitter  "человек,  сидящий  на
заборе" в конце статьи sit on the fence  "сидеть  на  заборе".  В  тех
случаях,  когда  понять  производную  форму,  опираясь   на   основное
объяснение, затруднительно, приводятся дополнительные объяснения. Если
идиома может употребляться в форме различных частей  речи,  приводится
отдельная статья на каждый случай.
   Ссылки показывают, что  объяснение  можно  найти  в  другом  месте.
Предположим, Вы хотите посмотреть выражение cast  in  one's  lot  with
(решить стать соучастниками или партнерами). Вы можете  посмотреть  на
слово cast (бросать) или на слово lot (судьба), ссылка направит Вас  к
слову throw в фразе throw in one's lot with. Причиной  этого  является
тот  факт,  что  слово  cast  (бросать)  употребляется  в  сегодняшнем
английском языке гораздо реже чем слово  throw.  Следовательно,  более
распространенная форма этой идиомы начинается глаголом throw.
   Указательная статья ведет нас ко всем  другим  статьям,  содержащим
искомое слово. Таким образом, слово chin  (подбородок)  сопровождается
фразами, в которых Вы найдете слово chin, таких как  keep  one's  chin
up, stick one's chin (or neck) out, take out, take it on the chin,  up
to the chin.


                         Указатели частей речи

   Лексемные  идиомы,  которые  мы  обсуждали   раньше,   сопровождены
указателем части речи. В некоторых  случаях,  таких,  как,  скажем,  в
случае предложных  фраз,  употреблен  двойной  указатель,  потому  что
данная фраза имеет два грамматических употребления. Буква <v.>  значит
verb (глагол); она напечатана в фразах, содержащих глагол  и  наречие,
или глагол и предлог, или все три, то есть глагол, предлог и  наречие.
Сокращение <v. phr.> означает "verbal phrase" как, например, look  up,
look in и т.д., то есть сочетание глагола с существительным: глагол  с
дополнением, глагол с подлежащим и глагол с предложной фразой.


                       Ограничительные указатели

   Иностранцу, для которого американский английский -  неродной  язык,
следует обратить особое внимание на то, в какой ситуации какую  идиому
можно употреблять. В этом  читателю  словаря  помогут  ограничительные
указатели. Так,  указатель  <slang>  (слэнг)  показывает,  что  идиома
употребляется только в фамильярном разговоре очень близкими  друзьями.
Указатель <informal> (неформальный) показывает,  что  выражение  может
употребляться в разговоре,  но  не  должно  встречаться  в  формальных
сочинениях.  Указатель  <formal>  (формальный)  имеет  противоположное
значение: он указывает,  что  форма  употребляется  только  в  научных
работах или при чтении лекции  в  университете.  Указатель  <literary>
(литературный)  напоминает,  что  интересующая  Вас  идиома  -  широко
известная цитата; ее не стоит  употреблять  слишком  часто.  Указатель
<vulgar>  (вульгарный,  грубый)  показывает,  что   Вам   не   следует
употреблять эту форму. Однако, иметь представление о  подобных  формах
необходимо, чтобы иметь возможность судить о людях по  языку,  который
они употребляют. Указатель <substandard> (не соответствующий  языковой
